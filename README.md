A clone to netflix app designed using Moviedb API and Firebase as database. I used tailwind css for easy build and interactive UI, further to keep logs of different users and authentication aspect, the cloud firestore. This is the first time I used a movie database API and learnt a lot from it.
To use and add CSS I used Tailwind CSS to amplify the smoothness of the user interface.
